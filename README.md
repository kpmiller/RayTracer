# RayTracer

This is an implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html).  It is mostly the stock code implemented as a Mac OS X Cocoa app.  I enjoyed this project very much.

Differences are:

1. Image viewed in a window that updates as the color buffer is updated.
2. Image can be saved as a PNG file
3. Multithreaded using GCD blocks
